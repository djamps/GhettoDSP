# GhettoDSP
 
GhettoDSP is a family of DSP, bluetooth and power supply boards for building (or converting to) wireless bluetooth speakers.

There are currently four boards:

* GhettoDSP - Bluetooth I2S receiver with up to 4 channels of DSP (ADAU1701-based)
* GhettoDAC - Dual PCM1502A DAC daughter card for GhettoDSP providing additional 4 outputs @ 2V RMS (total of 8)
* GhettoPWR - Power control, boost and buck converter, and BMS / charging for lithium batteries (4-8 cells)
* HooptyDSP - Stand-alone, 12V powered GhettoDSP with integrated power control for mobile/car audio use

This Arduino code is for GhettoDSP and HooptyDSP boards.

Work in progress.
